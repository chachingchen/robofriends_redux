state: a memory, web need memory to work

state management: 
redux makes state management simple by keep all state 
in a object and pass down to components as props

why redux: better state management once project grows

flux pattern: 
action -> dispatcher/function -> store/state -> view
			  uni direction
user trigger action(press button, dropdown)
dispatcher receives action
update state??
user see the view they ask for

redux === this.state

make changes = Reducer(Action) {
	return Store
}
